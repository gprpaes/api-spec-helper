# Contributing to api-spec-helper

Just open a pull request on a feature branch with your code.  
There is obviously a lot that needs to be done, with a few examples being:

- Improving overall code readability;
- Add support to .yml format;
- Allow further output customization;
- Add support to direct manipulation of existing Swagger files to facilitate content insertion;
- Add error handling
- Add tests
